# Crystallized's Pad Thing
This macro pad contains 12 keys, each containing RGB underglow and has a OLED Screen! This macropad uses QMK Firmware.

## What and Why?
I wanted to build my own macropad for at least for some uses cases. I couldn't think of any so I decided to emulating a mouse with this! Therefore I can control the mouse using "the keyboard" if you know what I mean! This could change in the near future when I can add modifiers to change between different key modes for different work flows!

Also I wanted to learn something new and get some hardware skills in, so this is a first step for me. Making my own PCB, trying out Fusion 360 for the first time and even coding my own firmware cause I like control! ðŸ˜ˆ
